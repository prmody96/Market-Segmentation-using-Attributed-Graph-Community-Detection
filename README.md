# Market-Segmentation-using-Attributed-Graph-Community-Detection

Divided a broad target market into subsets of consumers or businesses that have or are perceived to have common needs, interests, and priorities. Implemented a community detection algorithm for attributed graphs, found the relevant market segments, and evaluated the obtained segments via influence propagation. 
Algorithm used was SAC-1 which is described in this research paper : Community Detection based on Structural and Attribute Similarities
